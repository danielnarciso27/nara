For the Health of your Mac! (Perfect support for OS X EI Capitan)

OS Cleaner scans every inch of your system, removes gigabytes of junk in just two clicks, and helps you maintain your Mac’s health. 

OS Cleaner shows you what to clean, you just have to decide when. It scans everything on your Mac, including: your Mac’s Caches, Logs files, Chat histories, iTunes, Mail, Trash bins, duplicates files and even old files you’d forgotten about. Plus, it knows exactly what can be removed and what can’t.
